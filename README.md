# Platform 45 Frontend Challenge![Alt text](/designs/Frontend_Challenge_Desktop.png "Platform 45 Frontend Challenge")The challenge was to create a dynamic and responsive UI using pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript which has got a modern form layout with an overflow for additional content. ![Alt text](/designs/Mobile_View.gif "Mobile view demo")A simple dark theme has also been implemented for this UI for both mobile and desktop view. ![Alt text](/designs/Desktop_DT.png "Dark theme desktop") ![Alt text](/designs/Mobile_DT.png "Dark theme mobile")## ChallengesFrom this project, my main challenge was in refactoring the CSS. This is still something I would like to explore further and work on in future projects.  Another challenge I had was with customizing the date field to integrate an icon inside it, especially seeing as Chrome based browsers already have an icon inside which they use as a button to toggle the calendar. This is something I would like to further explore. ![Alt text](/designs/DTDemo.gif "Dark theme desktop demo")
